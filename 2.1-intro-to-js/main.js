// A: Nothing, it is only a declaration. We have not given it an assignment yet.

// A: "Tim"

// Create a variable to calculate Tim's age
// The answer should read "Tim is 32 years old"
// The answer shoud not be written in a comment.
var born = 1983;
var today = 2015;
// Answers Below:
var TimsAge = "Tim is " + today - born + " years old"
console.log(TimsAge);



// Store some information following in variables.
var yourName = "Daniel "
var instructorName = " Jason"

// Update the variables above so the expression reads correctly.
// Answers Below:
console.log(statement);

// Final Statement
var statement = yourName + " is taking a class at The Iron Yard, my instructor's name is " + instructorName;





// WHAT I LEARNED today
// OBJECT SYNTAX - AN OBJECT SYNTAX HAS CURLY BRACKETS {} AND IS USED TO INCLUDE COMPLEX DATA OR INFORMATION. IF WE HAVE AN OBJECT AND WOULD LIKE TO PULL THE INFORMATION WITHIN THE OBJECT {} WE JUST USE A DOT SYNTAX TO OPEN A SPECIFIC OBJECT.

// ARRAY SYNTAX - AN ARRAY SYNTAX IS USED FOR A COLLECTION OF THINGS. THERE CAN BE AS BIG OR AS SMALL OF A COLLECTION OF THINGS INSIDE AN ARRAY. IF WE WANTED TO OPEN A CERTAIN "ITEM OR COLLECTION" WE WOULD USE THE [] SYNTAX IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER. (I.E - 0,1,2,3)

// CONSOLE.LOG() - CONSOLE.LOG() ALLOWS US TO OPEN UP OR "CALL" AN ASSIGNED VARIABLE.
