    <ul data-js="studentsList">
      <li class="studentList__student" data-js="student">Daniel Leal
        <p>
          Noob in all things technological (or so he thinks), Daniel is making up for lost ground. Being "off" the grid for the better part of three years will do that to anyone. But his constant desire to understand and learn are key attributes that will play a huge role in his growth. "Try not. DO, or Do not... There is no try - Yoda"
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="studentList__student"
        data-js="student">Terika Collins
        <p>
          Fashionista and all around bad ass, Terika brings a whole new twist to
          code. Through her self talk (which is most helpful as her table partner)
          and steady workflow, she over comes any obstacle with ease.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="studentList__student"
        data-js="student">Justin Strayhorn
        <p>
          Calm, cool and collected.
          That about sums up J-Man. Never one to stray away from a challenge,
          Justin constantly pushes himself and others to cross the finish line.
          Oh and if you ask Justin what a callback is.. he'll be sure to tell you
          its a function passed to another function as a parameter.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="studentList__student"
        data-js="student">Jeremy Ward
        <p>
          Where to begin with Jeremy?
          So much information is inside of this mans' head, it's almost impossible
          to talk about anything that he is not familiar with. Always one to offer assistance and guidance no matter who is asking. Although his slack comments can be rather complex at times, I know his technoligical knowledge is going to be a key factor in my personal growth.
        </p>
    </li>

      <li class="studentList__student"
        data-js="student">David Rangel
      <p>
          Genius in black.
          What can't David do?? He is a walking computer capable of executing the most complex of tasks and laughing silently at any obstacle thrown at him. For loops? Please... jQuery Factory Call? C'mooooon! It's gonna take more than 12 weeks of bootcamp for David to break a sweat!
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="studentList__student"
      data-js="student">Sharice Pearson
      <p>
          Soft at heart with a strong intellect, you wont find another 'Reese' anytime soon. Her pin point accuracy (although she wont admit it) and attention to detail are key factors that will benefit her success. Ooohh and can you say Coffee connoisseur? She looks at code as a tall cup of Joe... and she's THIRSTY!
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="studentList__student"
      data-js="student">Nicolas Roybal
      <p>
          Slick-Nick Roybal should not be underestimated. He kicks back answers like Bruce Lee, and splices and splits strings like a kung-fu master!
          Is his reserve nature to be taken lightly?
          No way ke-mo-sah-be!
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="studentList__student"
      data-js="student">Lucio Gutierrez
      <p>
        Lucio the blog'oisseur! From band director to jr software dev in training, this mans'
        talents stretch far and wide. Need a good read about how Music theory and Code can go hand in hand? See link for info.
