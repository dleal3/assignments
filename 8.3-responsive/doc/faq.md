Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed in the <head>.

The main advantage of placing it in the <head> is that you will track the user's pageview even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded. However, having the code at the bottom of the page helps improve performance.

How can I integrate Bootstrap with HTML5 Boilerplate?

One simple way is to use Initializr and create a custom build that includes both HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap.

Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released?

No, same as you don't normally replace the foundation of a house once it was built. However, there is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes, but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.

Where can I get help with support questions?

Please ask for help on StackOverflow.
